# 🔍 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive **Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Visualize how famous graph algorithms explore and find the shortest path in a grid — step by step.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Multiple algorithms:
  - BFS (Breadth First Search)
  - DFS (Depth First Search)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Bidirectional BFS
- ✅ Weighted terrain (Grass = 2, Water = 5)
- ✅ 8-directional movement
- ✅ Step counter, path length, and runtime tracking
- ✅ Smooth animations with visited nodes + glowing path
- ✅ Guide modal with multi-slide tutorial

---

## 🖥 Usage
1. **Left-click** → Set Start, End, or Walls  
2. **Right-click** → Cycle terrain (Normal → Grass → Water)  
3. Select algorithm from dropdown → **Run**  
4. Press **Clear Grid** to reset
